This task is an image classification system using VGG-16 in PyTorch, processing a large image database with scaling, augmentation, and normalization. The model was fine-tuned and trained with k-fold cross-validation, tracking performance metrics. We evaluated accuracy, visualized results, and documented our findings in a final presentation
